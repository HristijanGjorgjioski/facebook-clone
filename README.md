# facebook-clone

This application is my the most complex app that I have built on my own!
This is not from any course or tutorial, i build everything by myself.
I have work on this application maybe for 5-6 weeks. 
Things that I have learned through building this app are enormous
This app is built in NodeJS, but I have use a lot more than NodeJS.
Others things that I have use are: ExpressJS, MongoDB, 
Express-Validator, Multer(for images upload), EJS, Bootstrap and CSS, 
CSERF Protection for login, JWT(json web token), SendGrid(for e-mail sending)
and a loooot more!

# IMPORTANT
Now I am learning ReactJS, and I have plan to continue working on this
app when I learn ReactJS and to make the app much more better that is now!
